The muxip may work in Trimui Brick, but it has not been tested on them.

2. Turn-on the device and scroll to APPS-Applications.
3. Click on 'Archive Manager' and runs the copy of the version you want to install.
4. MuOs will make the rest of work.

Note:  You can confirm the PPSSPP emulator is updated clicking in the quick emulator access from APPS-Applications.
